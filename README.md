# BitProphet
BitProphet is a node crypto trading platform for Binance exchange that uses chat bots as its interface. Its main purpose is the automation of trading techniques, but it can also be used as a simple order notification tracker or as an alert system for the most used technical indicators.
Suggestions and pull requests are very welcome!

#### Features
* Analyse hundreds of tokens in multiple intervals EVERY second
* Technical Indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, Stochastics, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku and more)
* Stop loss and trailing profits
* Paper trading
* Create your own strategies
* Be notified anywhere with Telegram or Discord

![Telegram Interface](https://github.com/andresilvasantos/bitprophet/raw/master/pres/chat_example.png)

#### Installation
```
npm install bitprophet --save
```

#### Setting Up Telegram Bot
First, you'll need to create a bot for Telegram. Just talk to [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and follow simple steps until it gives you a token for it.
You'll also need to create a Telegram group, the place where you and BitProphet will communicate. After creating it, add the bot as administrator (make sure to uncheck "All Members Are Admins").

#### Setting Up Discord Bot (optional)
Create a server and follow [these simple steps](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) until you have a token and added the bot to the server you've just created.

#### Retrieving Chat IDs
In order to find out the chat id where your bot was added to, run node with the following code and then just say something in the group/server. The bot will reply with the chat id.

```javascript
const bitprophet = require('bitprophet')
bitprophet.options({
    telegram: {
        token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    },
    discord: {
        token: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
})
bitprophet.listenToChatId()
```

![Chat ID](https://github.com/andresilvasantos/bitprophet/raw/master/pres/chat_id.png)

#### Getting Started
This is the code to start BitProphet. If the only thing you need is to be notified of trades, you're done.

```javascript
const bitprophet = require('bitprophet')
bitprophet.options({
    binance: {
        key: "YOUR_BINANCE_API_KEY",
        secret: "YOUR_BINANCE_API_SECRET"
    },
    telegram: {
        chatId: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID",
        token: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
    },
    discord: {
        chatId: "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID",
        token: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
})

bitprophet.start()
```

You should now see a message in Telegram/Discord telling you BitProphet has started.

In Telegram/Discord type __list__ and you'll see all the available strategies listed with the respective ids.
If a strategy listed has the [PT] prefix, it means it has Paper Trading active.
To start a strategy, just type __start strategy_id__. For example, __start buydip__.

#### Adding Strategies
Add the following option naming a new directory for your strategies.

```javascript
bitprophet.options({
    strategiesDir: "./path/my/strategies"
})
```

Create *index.js* inside that folder with the configuration for all your strategies
```javascript
module.exports = {
    strategies: {
        alertsbb: {
            name: "Alerts Bollinger Bands",
            targetMarket: "BTC"
        },
        quickdip: {
            name: "Quick Dip",
            //buyAmountMarket: 0.012,
            buyPercentageAccount: 0.01,
            profitTarget: 1.4,
            maxLoss: 0.8,
            maxTradingPairs: 4,
            targetMarket: "BTC"
        },
        ichitest: {
            name: "Ichimoku Test",
            paperTrading: true,
            buyAmountMarket: 0.012,
            profitTarget: 1.4,
            maxTradingPairs: 8,
            targetMarket: "BTC",
            excludeTokens: ["NEO", "TRX"]
        },
        //...
    }
}
```
